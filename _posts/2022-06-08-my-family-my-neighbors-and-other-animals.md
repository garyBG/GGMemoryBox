The memory work done through this project served a fundamental goal of centralizing my idea of home. I wanted to see if it is based entirely on an ethereal concept of a homeland or if I could ping it to a concrete place. The exploration that most resonated with me was a collage of digital and traditional media that would allow me to peer deeper into the cement, panel block I grew up in. The process featured a clay construction, which was roughly painted physically, then cleaned digitally, and juxtaposed against the scenery that surrounds it in real life (which was 3D-modeled). The clay was necessary to bring touch to the forefront of the remembrance process. This would allow me to inadvertently trigger certain memories as I worked up the levels, mimicking my scaling of them as a kid. This process was inspired most by the work of Frank Wong in Forever Chinatown, reminding me that each small piece I craft is imparted with the emotional residue it holds in real life. The combination of creation and remembrance has allowed me to definitively say, this singular piece of stone, steel, and brick may forever be a centering point for me.

Before I recall the stories that jumped at me, I remind myself and whoever reads this, that this is a work-in-progress. There is so much more meaning I can impute to this whole work, but as it stands I am limited by my technical skills.

**Floor 1 - Apt 2.**: My grandmother's apartment on the first floor has become a de-facto nursery, hospital, and coffee house for all members of our block. Her doors are always unlocked, and neighbours never ring before entering. The hearth of the block. This distinguished status is why, even when I am halfway around the world over the last decade, I am still cherished and taking care of by my neighbours. In turn, all those who she treats, watches, and comforts would do it all for her. ALways asking to pick up her groceries, to do her housework, to drive her where needed. Like a mob boss, she carefully delegates all the inner workings of the block.

**Floor 1 - Apt 5.**: A young couple moved there a couple of years ago. Their nightly arguments incessantly echo through the cold, stone halls. There are murmurs of the horrible abuse the man engages in as part of his nightly ritual. Being the culture that it is, nobody bats an eye. Some in the block encourage it, some just refuse to look at him.

**Floor 1 - Apt 7.**: A former tennis champion whose athletic career took her across the world. She talks with a gentle arrogance. She is always pushing her daughter too hard, though they seem happy. 

**Floor 2 - Apt 13**: The Doctor, known as Hajji Doctore for his pilgrimage to Mecca, who now in his 98th year of life and acts as a silent guardian of the elevator. He hobbles to the benches outside at 2:00 PM sharp every day, always giving a slight head-nod to passer- bys. His whole family distinguished medical professionals, and he their patriarch. Near deaf, he blasts his radio and TV first thing in the morning to the dismay of all those around him.

**Floor 3 - Apt 20**: A mom with two boys now entering their 20s. The tiny dog, always in her clutches, resembles her. Her sons are now Neo-Nazi gang-affiliated. Football stars turned hooligans who constantly terrorize the denizens of the Romani neighborhood across the street. With shaved heads and swastika brands, they stand proud in their ignorance. They pushed an elderly neighbor down the stairs some years back resulting in their complete ostracization. We all hate them.

**Floor 4 - Apt 24**: A fiery auntie who toils long hours to support her no-good husband. She bickers with all those around her, but never garners their hate, she does too much good. Her husband always tosses passer-bys sly smiles as he drinks his room-temp. beer from his LADA with deflated tires.

**Floor 6 - Apt 35**: An old Armenian couple who the bottles, plates, and buckets at the kids playing below. Together for five decades, they share in their hatred of kids.

**Floor 7 - Apt 44**: A Syrian family that moved after the civil war destroyed their home. Their daughter, one day younger than me, became an inseparable companion to me. 

**Floor 8 - Apt 54**: Dimitar, "The Headlight", a veteran alcoholic who has survived everything life throws at him. He has fallen from the first, second, and third stories without a scratch. Loves to throw rocks at his neighbors when they slight him.

**Floor 8 - Apt 56**: Nikolai, Dimitar's greatest Nemesis. A former opera singer who has let life get the best of him. Now he tents a large, stained beard from which he spouts creative insults. Frequently throws raw poultry at Dimitar's door.

**Floor 9 - Apt 62**: The older auntie walks around with an air of mystery around her. Routinely, at 1AM always, she descends from her high above to feed all the neighborhood cats. She controls them like an army of minions, ready to sick them on anyone who dares mean-mug her. Occasionally she sneaks to the basement always checking her back as if some agent from the Soviet era still follows her.

**Floor 10 - Apt 65**: My friend, mentor, and de-facto older brother's apartment. Left to tend to himself at the age of 15 as his family left for Germany without him. A happy, hardworking kid who would always pull me into his adventures, regardless of the gap in maturity between us. Four years after being left alone, he would lose his life. The 10th floor is a place I dare not step anymore.
