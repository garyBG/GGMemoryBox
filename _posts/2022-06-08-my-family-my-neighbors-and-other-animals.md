The memory work done through this project served a fundamental goal of centralizing my idea of home. I wanted to see if it is based entirely on an ethereal concept of a homeland or if I could ping it to a concrete place. The exploration that most resonated with me was a collage of digital and traditional media that would allow me to peer deeper into the cement, panel block I grew up in. The process featured a clay construction, which was roughly painted physically, then cleaned digitally, and juxtaposed against the scenery that surrounds it in real life (which was 3D-modeled). The clay was necessary to bring touch to the forefront of the remembrance process. This would allow me to inadvertently trigger certain memories as I worked up the levels, mimicking my scaling of them as a kid. This process was inspired most by the work of Frank Wong in Forever Chinatown, reminding me that each small piece I craft is imparted with the emotional residue it holds in real life. The combination of creation and remembrance has allowed me to definitively say, this singular piece of stone, steel, and brick may forever be a centering point for me.

Before I recall the stories that jumped at me, I remind myself and whoever reads this, that this is a work-in-progress. There is so much more meaning I can impute to this whole work, but as it stands I am limited by my technical skills.

The way my grandmother's apartment on the first floor has become a de-facto nursery, hospital, and cafe house for all neighbors. The bickering of the young couple three doors down that echoes through the cold, stone halls every night. The former tennis champion pushes her daughter a little too hard from the second floor. The Doctor, known as Hajji Doctore for his pilgrimage to Mecca, who now in his 98th year of life and acts as a silent guardian of the elevator. The redhead auntie who has gotten in a fight with damn-near every other family in the building but who we all still love. The Syrian family of my closest friend, who I consider kin, is on the third floor. The old Armenian couple on the other side of them whose main entertainment is pelting the children playing below with home goods. The kind dark-haired auntie of the fourth floor, whose neo-Nazi gang-affiliated sons terrorized our Romani friends. "The Headlight", an alcoholic with a short fuse and a voice of gold. All the babushkas who stand watch on their windows throughout the day like deadly snipers. The rickety elevator that challenges you to gamble your life every time you enter. The apartments which held friends now long departed. I want to tell the story of this building and how it has shaped a perverse vision of "home"
